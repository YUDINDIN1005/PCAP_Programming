This repository contains a simple TCP packet sniffer implemented in C using the PCAP library.
The program captures and analyzes TCP packet, specifically focusing on HTTP traffic.
It demonstrates how to utilize the PCAP library for packet capturing and decoding network protocols.

Features:
- Capture and display TCP packets
- Analyze HTTP requests and responses
- Print source and destination IP/MAC addresses
- Filter packets by port

This project is intended for educational purposes and to assist in understading network programming and packet analysis.
